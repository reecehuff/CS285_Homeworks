## Homework 4: Submission README

I ran the code locally, not on Google Colab, using a cuda-enabled GPU. 

## Running the experiments
### Option 1: Run all experiments

Simply make sure that you are in the hw4 directory and run the all_problems.sh bash script, i.e., 
```
. all_problems.sh
```

### Option 2: Run experiments individually 

Make sure that you are in the hw3 directory and then...

**Problem 1**

Run... 
```
. problem1.sh
```

**Problem 2**

Run... 
```
. problem2.sh
```

**Problem 3**

Run... 
```
. problem3.sh
```

**Problem 4**

Run... 
```
. problem4.sh
```

**Problem 5**

Run... 
```
. problem5.sh
```

**Problem 6**

Run... 
```
. problem6.sh
```

## Plotting the plots

Simply make sure that you are in the submit directory and run the plot.py script, i.e., 

Run... 
```
python plot.py
```

The plots will saved to the `figures` folder.
