## Homework 3: Submission README

I ran the code locally, not on Google Colab, using a cuda-enabled GPU. 

## Running the experiments
### Option 1: Run all experiments

Simply make sure that you are in the hw3 directory and run the all_questions.sh bash script, i.e., 
```
. all_questions.sh
```

### Option 2: Run experiments individually 

Make sure that you are in the hw3 directory and then...

**Question 1**

Run... 
```
. question1.sh
```

**Question 2**

Run... 
```
. question2.sh
```

**Question 3**

Run...

```

**Question 5**

## Plotting the plots
